# salinity_resistivity_calculator
This app is an open source resource that developed in Collaboration between Universitas Pertamina (Epo Prasetya Kusumah) and SPWLA - Indonesian Chapter. 

I build this app in two forms:
- Interactive Bokeh App (python)
  - This app require: numpy, pandas, bokeh, in order for the app to run in local server
  - You can start the app by command `bokeh serve --show app.py` in comand prompt, ssh or power shell

- Pure HTML + Js html file
  -  This app is pure HTML, you can download it or ember this html anyhere.
  -  To try, simply download the HTML and open it with any browser.

Enjoy!!
